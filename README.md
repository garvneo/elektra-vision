# elektra-vision
Designed and built Elektra, a smart tool leveraging python, ML and raspberry pi to provide an audio object identification for the visually impaired.

**Abstract :-**
- Elektra is a smart embedded assistive technology build for aiding the visually impaired and to help them in their day to day task. Elektra is a mini hand-held device for blind which may be used with walking cane or can be mounted inside a hat as a smart companion.
- There are basically three modules face and vehicle detection, distance calculation from an obstacle or objects, controlling of home other appliances with the help of Internet of Things respectively. Both display and voice feedbacks are provided for each mode of action or event that is occurring.
- The device features complete voice assistance for easy handling of the different modules. We have used Raspberry Pi3B+ Model for the processing purpose. Ultrasonic sensors are used for the purpose of proximity calculation. Harr Cascade feature based classification algorithm is used for the purpose of the face detection and vehicle detection.

**Future Aspect:**
Will try to incorporate the whole system and its working into a mobile app enables with the capability of reading / scanning a document and then reiterating it into words to the user in speech.
